// API :->

//      API (Application Programming Interface) in JavaScript acts as an interface that allows different software components to communicate with each other. 

//      It defines a set of rules and methods that developers can use to interact with external services, browsers, or system functionalities without needing to understand their internal implementation.

//  Think of an API like a waiter in a restaurant üçΩÔ∏è.

//  1.  You (the user) order food (request).
//  2.  The waiter (API) takes your order to the kitchen (server).
//  3.  The kitchen prepares the food (processes the request).
//  4.  The waiter brings the food back to you (response).

//    In JavaScript, an API helps your code talk to other services, like fetching data from a website, getting weather updates, or saving information in the browser.
